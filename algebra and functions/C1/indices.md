# indices

### Multiplying indices

just add the powers: `xᵐxⁿ = xᵐ⁺ⁿ`

**2³ x 2²**

```
= (2 x 2 x 2) x (2 x 2)

= 2⁵
```

**a⁵ x a⁴**

```
= a⁹
```

**3x² x 5x³**

```
= 15x⁵
```

**2x²y³ x 3xy²**

```
= 6x³y⁵
```

----

### Multiplying indices by indices

just multiply the powers: `(xᵐ)ⁿ = xᵐⁿ`

**(2³)²**

```
= (2 x 2 x 2) x (2 x 2 x 2)

= 2⁶
```

**(3a⁵)²**

```
= 9a¹⁰
```

**(2a³b²)³**

```
= 8a⁹b⁶
```

----

### Dividing indices by indices

just subtract the powers: `xᵐxⁿ = xᵐ⁻ⁿ`

**4⁵/4³**

```
= (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4) / (4 x 4 x 4)
= 4 x 4

= 4²
```

**12x⁵/3x³**

```
= 4x²
```

**5a²b³/10abc²**

```
= 1/2(ab²/c²)
= ab²/2c²
```

----

### Negative indices

negative indices refer to fractions: `x⁻ⁿ = 1/xⁿ`

**5³/5⁴**

```
= (5 x 5 x 5) / (5 x 5 x 5 x 5)
= (1 x 1 x 1) / (1 x 1 x 1 x 5)
= 1/5 or 1⁻⁵
```

**x³y²/xy⁵**

```
= x²y⁻³
= x²(1/y³)
= x²/y³
```

**12x³y²/14xy³z**

```
= 6x²y⁻¹/7z
= 6x²(1/y)/7z
= 6x²/7yz
```

----

### Fractions to negative indices

when a fraction is powered to a negative index, we can invert the fraction and change the index to positive.

following the rule for negative indices, `x⁻ⁿ = 1/xⁿ`:

```
(2/3)⁻² = 1/(2/3)²
        = 1/(2²/3²)
        = 3²/2²
        = (3/2)²
```

so `(x/y)⁻ⁿ = (y/x)ⁿ`

**(3 1/2)(x³)⁻²**

```
= (7/2)(x³)⁻²
= (7x³/2)⁻²
= (2/7x³)²
= 4/49x⁶

```

**(2x⁴/5y)⁻³**

```
= (5y/2x⁴)³
= (5y)³/(2x⁴)³
= 125y³/8x¹²
```
